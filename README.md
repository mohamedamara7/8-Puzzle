# 8-Puzzle
Solving 8-puzzle problem using uninformed and informed search algorithms.
-  The uninformed search algorithms that were used are:
    *  Depth-first search (DFS)
    *  Breadth-first search (BFS)
    *  Uniform-cost search (UCS)
-  The informed search algorithms that were used are:
    *  Greedy search
    *  A* search (BFS)

# Note
> DFS doesn't suit this problem. Thus, it usually takes a lot of time for hard versions of the problem.
