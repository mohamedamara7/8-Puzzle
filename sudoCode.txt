search(intial_state):
	create node { state , path , cost , ... }
	initialize fringe with initial state
	while fringe is not empty :
		pick a node from the fringe according to the search strategy
		if visited : continue
		if goal : return solution
		from state get possible actions
		from actions generate next states
		append successors to the fringe
	return failure
